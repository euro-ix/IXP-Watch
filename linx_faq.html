<P class="title">IXP Watch Information</P>

IXP Watch is a script that runs on a LINX Engineering<br>
server that has interfaces on the LINX peering network.<br>
<br>
Every 15 minutes, this script is called, and it samples 15 minutes of<br>
the currently visible traffic - broadcast and background traffic - and<br>
saves this in a traffic sample file.<br>
<br>
The engineering server also has bound to it, the IP addresses of members<br>
that have gone away ('sponged IP addresses') or members with long term<br>
problems with their LINX interfaces, (say, down for a few months or more) <br>
<br>
At the end of the 15 minutes the sample is saved, the script<br>
then looks at the contents of the traffic sample file (using tshark)<br>
and generates various plain text logs for different classes of traffic. <br>
For example, all ARP queries will be logged to a file, Non-IP frames<br>
logged to another file, and so on.<br>
<br>
These (big) log files are in turn summarized, de-duplicated, and brought<br>
together into one report file which then appears on the LINX web site. <br>
<br>
The log files are deleted once the report has been generated, and the<br>
traffic sample file itself is saved for further analysis if this is<br>
required.  (For example, if we see an OSPF request from 192.168.1.59, <br>
we will then need to inspect the sample file to see which MAC address is<br>
originating these frames.) <br>
<br>
The sections that may appear in the report are as follows:<br>
<br>
<B>1. TOP 30 ARPERS</B><br>
    Analysis of the top 30 hosts sending ARP requests. Whilst ARP is<br>
    a normal part of IP, hosts near the top of the list usually have<br>
    traffic destined for non-existent peers, or may just be a temporary<br>
    problem. ARPs generated may also be caused by network monitoring<br>
    systems trying to ping interfaces on the LINX peering network that<br>
    are unavailable, etc. (The number to the left of each line is the<br>
    count of the number of times that ARP request was seen in the sample.)<br>
<br>
    Troubleshooting ARP:<br>
<br><ul> 
    <li>Generally, as the MAC addresses on the LINX LAN remain fairly
       static, set your ARP cache to a reasonably high timeout value.
       When most ARP implementations see a different MAC address for
       an already cached IP address, it will delete the old one from
       its arp cache and use the new value instead.</li>
    <li>Check for BGP sessions in Active state for peers that have gone
       away either temporarily or permanently. Use the Looking
       glasses / collector routers to verify the information.</li>
    <li>Check any network monitoring systems that ping addresses on
       the LINX LAN are up to date.</li>
    <li>Gratuitous ARP - a host sends an ARP for its own IP address
       in order to determine if another host on the same network
       already has its IP address. If it gets a response then it
       generally disables the interface and/or logs an error message.
       (Duplicate IP Address detection, auto-configuration tools etc.)
       - This feature can usually be turned off or reduced.</li>
    <li>Proxy ARP - a host - generally a router - replies to ARP requests
       for IP addresses other than itself. Very dangerous and you should
       disable it explicitly on your LINX interfaces. Particularly Cisco
       routers where, if on our /23 network, you accidentally configured A
       /24 mask, the Cisco may then start to reply to ARP requests for hosts
       that are not in your interface's configured /24 "subnet"</li>
</ul>
<br>
<B>2.  BGP OPEN ATTEMPTS FOR RECLAIMED/DOWN IP ADDRESSES</B><br> 
    Summary of routers that have been trying to establish BGP sessions to peers that have gone.
    (which we can see being flooded to the LINX Network.)<br>
    The BGP session will usually remain in Active state.<br>
    This also logs tcp SYN requests for sponged IP addresses.<br>
<br>
    Generally an indication of a peering session that should be turned off.<br>
<br>
    Troubleshooting BGP Dead Sessions:<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Check for sessions in Active state on your routers and follow them up - 
       can you ping the interface? Has the IP address been sponged
       (If you CAN ping it, Compare the MAC address. If the MAC
        address is <samp>00:90:27:12:bf:ce</samp> or <samp>00:90:27:12:42:06</samp> then this
        IP address is on the LINX Engineering server.)</li>
    <li>Are you trying to establish a session to the right AS?
       The IP Address may have changed hands, AS could have changed etc.
       Check for mismatched AS numbers etc.</li>
    <li>Look on the linx OPS list for previous announcements from the
       AS concerned. Use the <A HREF="/tools/">LINX Looking Glass</A> / collector router to
       see what sessions exist there.</li>
</ul>
<B>3.  MARTIAN/ODD SNMP  </B><br>
    SNMP requests being flooded to the peering network. Usually<br>
    something trying to SNMP GET to an interface that is down.<br>
<br>
    Troubleshooting Martian/Odd SNMP:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Check your Network Monitoring System!</li>
    <li>Check the routes to the interfaces are going the way you think.</li>
    <li>Better still, use a loopback address (from your own IP range) </li>
       to monitor SNMP internally.</li>
</ul>
<B>4.  SPONGE ARP REPLY ACTIVITY</B><br>
    Included for information. If the engineering server responds to ARP<br>
    requests for one of its IP addresses (sponged) then it will be<br>
    recorded here. Some implementations seem to ARP for everything on the<br>
    entire subnet anyway.<br>
<br>
<B>5.  NON IP TRAFFIC</B><br>
    Anything not IPv4 is logged here.<br>
    Includes: DEC, IPX, Loopback, SNA, NETBIOS, Spanning Tree,<br>
    Vendor proprietary discovery protocols (CDP, EDP...)<br>
    And just corrupted frames.<br>
<br>
    Troubleshooting non-IP traffic:<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Disable the offending protocol.<br>
       i.e. Configure 'no cdp enable' on the LINX interface. (Cisco)</li>
    <li>"DEC DNA Remote Console" is DEC MOP.
       Configure 'no mop enabled' on your LINX Interface. (Cisco)
       We have had reports that some versions of IOS have this feature
       enabled but there is no command to turn it off. (i.e. DECNet
       was removed from the CLI but some of it still is in the code!)</li>
    <li>LOOP Loopback traffic - Keepalives.
       Legacy keepalive/AUI/heartbeat frames being sent.
       Used to determine if a transceiver is alive.
       Most modern interfaces spot carrier transitions without the
       need for these heartbeat frames.
       Configure 'no keepalive' on your LINX Interface. (Cisco)</li>
    <li>Garbage?
       LINX will generally contact you if your router is emitting
       large amounts of corrupted frames. Since the MAC Addresses are
       corrupted, i.e. &quot;0e:a4:04:b8:02:95 -&gt; 95:a7:d7:e0:28:50&quot;
       LINX will have to investigate these MAC addresses on the switches
       to determine where the corrupted frames are coming from.
       <br>
       Check for overloaded interfaces and duplex mismatches.<br>
       (All LINX interfaces are no auto negotiation, full duplex.)<br>
       We have also seen this caused by software bugs and leaky<br>
       VLANS, Broken tunelling protocols, overloaded CPU/buffers etc.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<B>6.  NON UNICAST IP TRAFFIC</B><br>
    Any IP packets directed to a multicast or broadcast address.<br>
    Includes:  OSPF, DHCP, RIP, EIGRP, PIM etc.<br>
<br>
    Troubleshooting Non Unicast IP Traffic:<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Disable the IGP on your LINX interface (passive-interface)</li>
    <li>Disable DHCP announcements (unconfigured interfaces etc.)</li>
    <li>Unconfigured Cisco DNS settings sends DNS requests to 255.255.255.255</li>
    <li>Unconfigured Cisco TFTP tries to tftp to 255.255.255.255<br>
       (set the ip tftp source-interface to be the correct interface.)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<B>7.  ICMP MESSAGES</B><br>
    For information. Generally ICMP to sponged IP addresses, or ICMP<br>
    that can be seen flooded to the LINX LAN.<br>
    Can indicate black holes or interesting routing.<br>
<br>
<B>8.  NEW ALARMS SINCE LAST RUN</B><br>
    New Non-IP Traffic/Non Unicast IP Traffic/STP etc that has been<br>
    seen since the last 15 minute sample.<br>
<br>
    Alerts the LINX on-call engineer about the new (non MoU compliant) traffic via e-mail<br>
    and certain things also get a pager message. We only want this once<br>
    though, not for every instance of the frame!<br>
<br>
    New alarms since last run is a section that appears when there are<br>
    new things that the IXP Watch hasn't seen before.<br>
<br>
    We also periodically clear down the cache of things seen, as it can<br>
    get pretty big if somebody is sending corrupted frames/garbage<br>
    (each corrupted frame is unique, usually seen only once.)<br>
