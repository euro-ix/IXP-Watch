# Script to manage 'arp sponges' without too much hassle.
#
# 2003-08-12 - Added path to "ip" because Redhat doesn't put
# /sbin in user paths by default.

#
# 2012-05-17 - <rob@lonap.net> Note there are better things than
# This available now for controlling ARP. But as this works
# nicely with ixp-watch reports, it is left here as-is.
# (Works with linux. Untested on other platforms.)
#
# 2020-08-22: - <rob@lonap.net> Use sipcalc if available for subnet checking.
# - Roll in some LONAP changes and improvements.
# - Timestamp and decimal for /etc/arpsponges to allow easier sorting and history
#   (this requires a change to /etc/arpsponges to work: it's now:
#       <ip_decimal> <date_added> <ip address>
#   e.g 87642128 2019-11-18 5.57.80.16
