* 1.16a 2023-05-09 - robl
  - Bugfix: Do not try to copy the report via slack on arp alert, only email.
  - Bugfix: RRD Graph PNGs not updated.

   - Move things to functions to avoid repeated code in many places.
    - Error handling / alerting is now more consistent
    - do_alert: Handle all alerts/emails/log output in function
    - log_error: Handle all error output logs in function
    - check_errors: Handle checking for log_error logs
    - die/cleanup/cleanexit: Clean up on exit, trap CTRL-C
    - required_vars: Check all variables required for proper operation are set before continuing
    - create_report/report/report_header/report_section_file - For building reports
    - do_graph: create and update rrd graphs
   - do_alert: Add slack alerter
   - Make path to logger prog config variable.
   - Configure syslog options in install script
   - Better error handling if called programs return non-zero
   - Check we can execute tshark before starting capture
   - Log stderror output from tshark capture if it fails to run correctly
   - Replace backticks with newer $(command) syntax

* 1.15.1 2021-07-06 - robl
   - Bugfix: Exit after sample file size exceeds MAX_SAMPLE_SIZE.
   - Move more options to config file
   - Make update_ethers tool use CONFIG.
   - Fix auto_sponge/sponge to use -c <config> without breaking existing cmd options
   
* 1.15 2021-06-24 - robl
   - Move example config file location and default location to avoid clash
     when installing via automation/git.
  -  Set default config location to /etc/ixpwatch
   - Make ALARM_PAGER optional.
   - [Issue #4] Move COUNTSFILE to config, reorder config vars so it works correctly.
   - Simple install script (works with debian/ubuntu to install from repository)
   - Make sponge utility use CONFIG file.
   - Make ixp-watch-tidy utility use CONFIG file.

* 1.14 - 2021-06-23 - robl
  - IPv6 is a thing now. Removed option to disable IPv6 processing.
  - Add report and alert for IPv6 Router Advertisements.
  - Fixes [Issue #3]: Use better tests -z and -n instead of == operator 
    and "" to test empty values. (This was throwing an error in some 
    environments if POSIX-incompatible shell is used)
  - Make the dead BGP sessions output more useful by resolving IPs. To use 
    old format instead, set BGPOPENS_OLD_FORMAT=1
  - Move user config variables to a seperate file to make upgrades easier.
  - Config file can now be specified with "-c <filename>" to make
    running multiple instances for multiple LANs easier.

* 1.13 - 2020-10-25 - robl
  - Run disk space checks before starting sample capture, not after. 
    This means it works if the disk is already full. It will now be run even 
    if capture fails or the script exits for some reason. It might also free 
    up enough disk space for the capture to succeed, rather than the capture
    failing and the script exiting before the disk space check/purge can run.

  - Make disk space check optional. (Don't do the check if DISK_PERCENT_PROG is 
    undefined (commented out) or empty.)

  - Bugfix: [Issue #2]: Correct non-unicast filter to use >= 224.0.0.0 and 
    not >= 223.0.0.0

* 1.12 - 2020-10-09 - robl
  - Bugfix: Improve matching on MY_IP for ICMP/sponge.

* 1.11 - 2020-08-24 - robl
  - Roll in some LONAP changes.
  - Better method of managing disk space / automatically remove samples if disk space
    becomes low.
  - Changes to ifconfig / use ip cmd instead.
  - Changes to syslog / loghost
  - Other small changes and bugfixes.
  - Update html examples.
  - Add IXP-Manager sponge automation tool and example cgi (see files in ./IXP-Manager)

* 1.10 - 2018-01-24 - robl

  - Roll in some LONAP changes.
  - Update TSHARK commands for updated version of tshark (requires explicit
    "-Y" filter flag for reading samples.)
  - Newer versions of tshark require "-f" capture filter.
  - Add IPv6 Traffic type summary to report.
  - Fixed IPv4 ICMP output (tshark output format changed)
  - Minor changes to docs and comments.
  - Included html files from LONAP as example for RRD stats page.

* 1.9 - 2012-05-17 - robl

  - Changed references to tethereal in EURO-IX released version to tshark.
  - Added basic RRDtool graph and html stats functionality.
  - Other small changes.
  - Include revised ixp-watch-tidy cron script.
  - bug fix: newer versions of tshark changed output slightly for ARP.
  - Now has GPL2 License as of 1.9 release. See LICENSE and LICENSE_OLD

* 1.8 - 2005-12-30 - robl
  - better handling of huge samples with the MAX_SAMPLE_SIZE parameter.
    Do not attempt to process a huge sample file, but just report this.
    - i.e, do not try to process a 2GB sample received if the network breaks!
  - You can optionally automatically delete huge samples to save disk space.
    - see ENORMOUS_SAMPLE.
  - run gzip with "nice -n 10" to reduce CPU on the box.
  - run GZIP process in the background and don't wait for it to finish.
  - now logs excess ARP events to syslog.
  - now logs when ARP levels return to normal to syslog.
  - exclude my own primary IP from capture samples.
  - bug fix: newer versions of tethereal changed output slightly for CDP.

* 1.7-interim 2003-10-20 - robl
  - better handling of l2tp and GRE traffic spew.
  - bug fix: sponge tool - added full path name to "ip" commands.
  - changed some of the tethereal command lines not to DNS resolve
    when reading sample files, as when a large sample file comes in, 
    this is too CPU intensive and/or takes too long to process.
  - bug fix: alarms_arp.tmp file was in the wrong location.
    (changed to $LOG_ROOT instead of $LOGDIR)
  - NB: There has been an updated release of tethereal fixes 
        several security holes. Also, I discovered my version was
        crashing when it encountered an SNMP packet because of missing
        snmp library. My version is now:

        tethereal 0.9.14
        Compiled with GLib 1.2.10, with libpcap 0.6, with libz 1.1.3,
        without UCD-SNMP or Net-SNMP, without ADNS
        Running on Linux 2.4.18

* 1.7  - 2003-04-10 - robl
  - Things re-named to IXP Watch for marketing/copyright reasons :)
  - LICENCE File added. Just in case you were not sure!
  - Reports now show minutes rather than seconds duration.
  - New counter for "ARPS Per minute" added. (Now we know minutes!)
  - Added ARP storm detection and alerting feature
  - Ability to write metrics for RRD graphs/monitoring system to a file.
    (see WRITE_COUNTS and COUNTSFILE options)

  - Documentation updated.

  - Changed "sponge" tool: I accidentally hardcoded my "eth3.1" interface
    into the awk line for "apply". Oops. Fixed so awk reads in $INTERFACE.

  - Integrated Arnold Nipper's contributions. :-)

+ >>>  - 2003-03-18 - arnold (DE-CIX)
  - Added $MY_IP line for Solaris.
  - Added $MY_ETHER line for Solaris.
  - Added IPv6 address support
  - New counter for IPv6 packets added.
  - Added Top ARP targets feature (IP addresses being ARPed most)
  - Change to awk expression to remove "?" in "arping for" lists.
  - Tweak to Dead BGP report sorting.
  - Other minor changes.


* 1.6 - 2003-01-30 - robl
  - Added "and not ICMP" to bgp sample line.
  - Changed ICMP report option to not report ICMP to $MY_IP.
  - Corrected a spelling mistake in the TODO file.
  - Redhat MY_IP= bit didn't seem to be working. 
    Was returning mask and not IP. Corrected the awk statement.
  - Included my "sponge" tool (for linux only) for managing arp sponges.
    (In need of a little work but it is stable.)
     Requires that /sbin/ip be suid root if non-root users wish to run it.

  Initial release.
